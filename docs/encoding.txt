Given N numbers and a base to encode to

Convert all the numbers to their binary representation
interleave the bits to one complete bit sequence
Group this bit sequence into bytes, and encode these bytes using the
given base

return the character sequence

# Interleaving:

`interleaving` is the process of mixing the bits together in the
correct sequence so that the z-order curve sequencing is achieved

Assume given 4 numbers:
10  -> 01010
8   -> 01000
31  -> 11111
15  -> 01111

Easiest to illustrate using tables:
Show these binaries columnated

+----+----+----+----+
| 10 | 8  | 31 | 15 |
+====+====+====+====+
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
+----+----+----+----+
| 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
+----+----+----+----+
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  |
+----+----+----+----+
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  |
+----+----+----+----+
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  |
+----+----+----+----+

Then combine the bits row by row 

+----+----+----+----+
| 10 | 8  | 31 | 15 |
+====+====+====+====+
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | => 0011
+----+----+----+----+
| 1  | 0  | 1  | 1  | => 1011
+----+----+----+----+
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 1  | => 0011
+----+----+----+----+
| 1  | 1  | 1  | 1  | => 1111
+----+----+----+----+
| 0  | 0  | 1  | 0  | => 0010
+----+----+----+----+

Combine to a complete bit sequence:

0011-1011-0011-1111-0010

Group this bit sequence to chunks encodable by the base
E.g:    base64 can encode in group of 6 bits (log2(64) = 6)
        base32 can encode in groups of 5 bits (log2(32) = 5)

So for example if encoding in base64:
0011-1011-0011-1111-0010
-> 00-111011-001111-110010
The trailing group of 10 will be padded out with null '0' bits
00 => 000000 (little endian)

So the final sequence is:
000000-111011-001111-110010
Which using base64 gives

Or in Base32:
Which encodes in groups of 5 bits:
0011-1011-0011-1111-0010
Becomes:
00111-01100-11111-10010

Which is (using https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html#section-6):

# Advantages:

The power of z-order curve encoding arises when it is used to encode
bit sequences that are trunkatable

For example, if we represent a binary search between a range 0 & M
in binary, where 0 indicates the true value is betwen 0 & m (= M / 2)
and 1 indicates it is between m & M

Then the number of bits given represent the depth of the search.
For a given group of search results, interleaved together encoded
using an encoding base that corresponds to the number of sequences

e.g: Use base16 for 4 groups, base32 for 5 groups, etc... (2^N, N=# groups)

Then each interleaved and encoded character in the sequence is a search
depth.

If we truncate the final encoded sequence to L characters, then we are
truncating the binary search to L iterations
