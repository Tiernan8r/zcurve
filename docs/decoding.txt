Given a sequence of encoded numbers, the encoding base, and the amount of numbers to decode to
(seq, base, N)

Decode the `seq` to a binary string
De-interleave the binary sequence to N groups

Convert those binary groups to digits as desired

# De-Interleaving:

`de-interleaving` is the process of un-mixing the bits to their correct
grouping

For example, say we have the bit sequence 010111000101 that we want to
separate into 3 groups, we do as follows

BIT SEQUENCE:   0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1
                ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
GROUP#:         3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1

(Remember is little-endian, so read right to left!)

So that group 1 is:
1010

Group 2:
0011

Group 3:
1010
